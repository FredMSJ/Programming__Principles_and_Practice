1. What is meant by the term prompt?
  Because it prompts the user to take an action.

2. Which operator do you use to read into a variable?
  (=)

3. If you want the user to imput an integer value into your program for a variable
named number, what are two lines of code you could write to ask the user to do it and
to input the value into your program?
  int number;
  cin >> number;

4. What is \n called and what purpose does it serve?
  Is a especial character indicating a newline.

5. What terminates input into a string?
  A string (by default) is terminated by whitespace. And if the formatting doesn't match.

6. What terminates input into an integer?
  When the formatting doesn't match.

7. How would you write (code) as a single line of code?
  cout << "Hello, " << first_name << "!\n";

8. What is an object?
  An object is some memory that holds a value of a given type.

9. What is a literal?
  Literal represents values of various types. For exemple, the literal 12 represents the integer value "twelve".
  "Morning" represents the caracter string value Morning, and true represents the Boolean value true.

10. What kinds of literals are there?
  As many type exists :D

11. Whats is a variable?
  Is a named object. 

12. What are typical size for a char, an int, and a double?
  Char == 1byte (8bits), Int == 4bytes, Double == 8bytes.

13. What measures do we use for the size of small entities in memory, such as ints and strings?
  bits.

14. What is the diference  between = and ==?
  = is to set some valor. == is to compare. 

15. What is definition? 
  Is a declaration that sets aside memory for an object.

16. What is an initialization and how dows it differ from an assignment?
  Is the initialize of an object. Initialization doesen't need set some value. 
  Assignment is that; set some value in memory. 

17. What is string concatenation and how do you make it work in C++?

  latest thing == false (whitespace)
  MiniMineMine == true (but not recommended)
  This_1_is fine == false (whitespace)
  the_$12_method == false ($ is not valid)
  number == true 
  2_For_1_special == false (must start with a letter)
  _this_is_ok == true (but system code or machine-generated code might have names with underscores. Avoid it)
  correct? == false (must contain only letters, digits ,and underscores)

19. Give five examples of legal names that you shouldn't use because they are likely to cause confusion.
  first
  thing
  s7
  back
  str1ngs

20. What are some good rules for choosing names?
  Choose meaningful names. Choose names that will help people understand your program. 
  Avoid abbreviations and acronyms.

21. What is type safety and why is it important?
  Is type-safety when objects are used only according to the rules for their type.
  Type-safety is a pack of good habits that'll save you a lot of grief.

22. Why can conversion from double to int be a bad thing?
  Because the value stored might differ from the value assigned.

23. Define a rule to help decife if a conversion from one type to another is safe or unsafe.
  When the value doesen't have gain or lost of content == safe
  else == unsafe.
